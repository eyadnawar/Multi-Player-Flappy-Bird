# Multi-Player-Flappy-Bird

In this project, I introduced a new multi-player feature over a connected network link in the Flappy Bird game. 

For each action a user takes, a data packet is sent containing that action and parsed them at the other side of the network.

Both objects (birds) are added on each screen and their instantaneous position is Adjusted over the network.
